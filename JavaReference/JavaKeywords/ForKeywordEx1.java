/*
 * The for loop loops through a block of code a number of times.
 * From the example above:
 * Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts int i = 0;
 * Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run(i must e less than 5). If the
 * condition is true, the loop will start over again, if it is false, the loop will end.
 * Statement 3 increases a value i++ each time the code block in the loop has been
 * executed.
